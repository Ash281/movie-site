{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"poceA8WA1Old"},"source":["# Intro\n","My plan is to use SBERT to primarily analyse movie plots, but also actors, genres, country and various metadata from a movie dataset to then find similar movies via Facebook AI Similarity Search. This will be my content based filtering. Then, to show new movies that may not be in the dataset, I will employ collaborative filtering by recommending movies that users with similar preferences interacted with, which may or may not be in the dataset. This way I can come up with a hybrid approach which accurately recommends movies but also can branch out of the dataset and give new recommendations. Additionally I can add these unseen movies to my dataset and further improve future recommendations."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cFZ_nTYAjkNp"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1YXCkX9_KLRE"},"source":["#
